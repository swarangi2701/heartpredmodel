# Waste app with Streamlit

## General info

That is a simple Streamlit application with using a Deep Learning model to determine if a given waste are recycle or organic. 
We used a previous trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithm to detect waste. The project and code for this application is available [here](https://github.com/aniass/Waste-Classification).
